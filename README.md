# My Projects

1) https://github.com/LenaMikhniuk/VolyaApp

  This app I've made for my daughter. Here you can listen to music or fairytales, take photos and even know the weather forecast (your child can choose how to dress up-the pictures change because of the weather condition). 


2) https://github.com/LenaMikhniuk/NewsApp

  A simple app with the use of the rest API. You can save news you like and then delete them. Also you can find an interesting animation here.
